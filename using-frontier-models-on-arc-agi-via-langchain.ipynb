    "# Using Frontier Models on ARC-AGI via LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll walk through a basic \"hello world\" example of using an LLM on [ARC-AGI tasks](https://arcprize.org/). This notebook is for demonstration purposes only. We encourage you to evolve it with your own ideas!\n",
    "\n",
    "While notebooks like these are not eligible for [ARC Prize 2024](https://arcprize.org/competition), they can be used to make a submission to [ARC-AGI-Pub](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi-pub), a separate leaderboard which allows API calls. For more information on ARC-AGI-Pub visit the [leaderboard](https://arcprize.org/leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to reach out to the ARC Prize team on [X](https://twitter.com/arcprize), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_rdrp-QkrZn-ce9uCE-0EA), [Discord](https://discord.gg/9b77dPAmcA) or team@arcprize.org for questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Create a `submission.json` file with our predictions for each challenge. Even though we are not submitting to Kaggle we will use this file to score ourselves against the public task sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are starting with a new notebook instance, so we'll first have to install our packages. We'll use [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/introduction), an open source library for LLM orchestration, for their ability to help with swapping models, prompt template and output parsing.\n",

    "Awesome! Congratulations. You just made a predicted outputs to ARC-AGI tasks using gpt-4o. Remember, with LangChain you can easily swap out different models. How do you think [claude-3.5-sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) would do?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to make a ARC-AGI-Pub high-score claim, run your model against `kaggle/input/arc-prize-2024/arc-agi_evaluation_challenges.json` and report your score [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyPg16R2BmGb6nZpsTAty4HqI4WjhpZcg951ApjzSfHJ7Kpw/viewform). Serious submissions will be considered to be tested against a semi-private set of challenges. Top scores of ARC-AGI-Pub will be reported on the [ARC-AGI-Pub Leaderboard](https://arcprize.org/leaderboard).\n",
